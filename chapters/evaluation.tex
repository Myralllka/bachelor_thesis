For computing the error of each camera calibration, another tool from the same ROS camera calibration package is used.
It outputs a reprojection $\mathsf{RMS}$ error, which stands for Root-mean-square error and can be defined As
\begin{equation}
    \mathsf{RMS}(x | \hat{x} ) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2}}{N}}
\end{equation}

Where $x$ is a measured data sample from the experiment, $\hat{x}$ is a ground-truth data and $N$ is a samle size.
The reprojection error varies depends on the pose of the chessboard with upper bound of less than $1px$, which is quite precise.
