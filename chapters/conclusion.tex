% Here the proposed algorithm can help - it gives common points to an algorithm, so instead of SfM from 2 images it does SfM from 4 images but with bigger pressision, because $T_{static}$ remains the same, and the only necessary transformation that should be estimated is $T_{t_0t_1}$, and the innertial module can help with that.

% Another possible approach is to use already working SfM algorithm implementation for a left and rigth camera separately to obtaine two pointclouds, and then align them and fix a scale using Iterative closest point algorithm with respect to fixed red pointcloud
